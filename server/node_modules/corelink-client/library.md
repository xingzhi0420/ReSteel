<h1><b>What is module.exports?</b> </h1>
<p>The module.exports or exports is a special object which is included in every JS file in the Node.js application by default. 
Module is a variable that represents current module and exports is an object that will be exposed as a module. So, whatever you assign to module.exports or exports, will be exposed as a module.</p>

<h2> Some module.exports used in the code: </h2>
//ADD CODE SNIPPETS EVERYWHERE
<ul type='disc'>
<br><li>module.exports.on = on </br> </li>
<p>stream.on - Call the on function with either data or close function.</p>
<p>
(i)data:The module is defined to parse JSON data. The client checks for the 'function' in data.The event 'update' or 'status' will be triggered and accordingly 'receiver_cb' or 'stale_cb' will be checked for null values. 
</p>
<p>
(ii) close : The callback function close_cb is checked for null values and close_cb() is called.</p>
<br><li>module.exports.connect = connect </br> </li>
The 'connect' module connects with client at the specified Port and IP number after verifying login credentials like username,password and token defined in the 'login' function.If the credentials are incorrect then it throws an error.
The 'await' keyword waits for a value of ControlPort and ControlIP. The module ends with a Promise. A promise is an object which can be returned synchronously from an asynchronous function.

<br><li>module.exports.createSender = createSender </br> </li>
Requests a 'sender' function from Corelink protocol which  needs input like workspace,protocol,Source IP, token etc. The client awaits to read, after which it parses the JSON data.
<br>The statusCode checks for streamid,port,MTU and message in the content.After getting values for workspace,protocol,type and metadata, UDP protocol is set up. </br>

<br><li>module.exports.send = send </br></li>
<p> The function first checks if the array of streamids is not empty as well as the protocol set up is UDP. After the header and packet are defined,the message is send at the appropriate port number and target IP. </p>

<br><li>module.exports.subscribe = subscribe </br></li>
<p>In the request made, subscribe function from Corelink protocol is called which gets the value of streamid and token. Further,the streamlist array is checked to see if it has target streamlist.  </p>
<br><li>module.exports.disconnect = disconnect </br></li>
<p>Requests a 'disconnect' function from Corelink protocol which  needs input like workspace,protocol,Source IP, token etc.</p>
<br><li>module.exports.createReceiver = createReceiver </br></li>
<p>It takes arameters streamid and port and requests a receiver function from Corelink protocol which has inputs workspace name, streamid,source IP,token etc. 
Further,it checks for  statusCode,streamid,port,potocol,streamlist,MTU. UDP protocol is the set up on receiver's side. <p>

<br><li>module.exports.exit = exit </br></li>
<p>This module gets all local streamids and,checks if they are undefined and pushes them. The connection then waits for a disconnect to occur. </p>
</ul>
